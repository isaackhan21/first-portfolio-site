This is my personal portfolio site which displays my best portfolio projects. The site also displays a welcome screen, skills and a contact section. 
I chose a nice milimilistic design for my site as I wanted to give the best user experience possible. I used a lot of white colors which goes really well with a black background.

The site also has some fun sliding card effects for each section.

The App was built in HTML, CSS and minimal Javascript.
